# App architecture

I used cloud functions from firebase to build an API endpoint (this was integrated with Express.js as well) and developped an app using react as front end hosted on firebase, that allows the user to input the n-th number they want to get from the fibonacci sequence and send a request to the API endpoint I built that calculates that.
Then the request is saved in cloud firestore database. In the frontend of the app I then grab all the requests made that are saved in the Cloud firestore and present the value of the n-th number of the fibonacci sequence that the user asked for.
I chose to host the app in firebase since it is pretty straight forward and already knew how to use it, same thing applies to choosing cloud firestore as database.
I chose react as a front end since it is my go to front end framework and really enjoy, I also know that it is a modern javascript framework with a few similarities to Angular, so I though it was the appropriate choice, since I haven't learned angular (although that isn't a problem when the time comes).
I incorporated the API creation with express.js since I had already used it and it was the recommendation from the cloud functions documentation.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
